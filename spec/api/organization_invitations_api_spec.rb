  # unit tests for create_organization_invitation
  # Create and send an organization invitation
  # Creates a new organization invitation and sends an email to the provided &#x60;email_address&#x60; with a link to accept the invitation and join the organization. You can specify the &#x60;role&#x60; for the invited organization member.  New organization invitations get a \&quot;pending\&quot; status until they are revoked by an organization administrator or accepted by the invitee.  The request body supports passing an optional &#x60;redirect_url&#x60; parameter. When the invited user clicks the link to accept the invitation, they will be redirected to the URL provided. Use this parameter to implement a custom invitation acceptance flow.  You must specify the ID of the user that will send the invitation with the &#x60;inviter_user_id&#x60; parameter. That user must be a member with administrator privileges in the organization. Only \&quot;admin\&quot; members can create organization invitations.  You can optionally provide public and private metadata for the organization invitation. The public metadata are visible by both the Frontend and the Backend whereas the private ones only by the Backend. When the organization invitation is accepted, the metadata will be transferred to the newly created organization membership.
  # @param organization_id The ID of the organization for which to send the invitation

  # unit tests for create_organization_invitation_bulk
  # Bulk create and send organization invitations
  # Creates new organization invitations in bulk and sends out emails to the provided email addresses with a link to accept the invitation and join the organization. You can specify a different &#x60;role&#x60; for each invited organization member. New organization invitations get a \&quot;pending\&quot; status until they are revoked by an organization administrator or accepted by the invitee. The request body supports passing an optional &#x60;redirect_url&#x60; parameter for each invitation. When the invited user clicks the link to accept the invitation, they will be redirected to the provided URL. Use this parameter to implement a custom invitation acceptance flow. You must specify the ID of the user that will send the invitation with the &#x60;inviter_user_id&#x60; parameter. Each invitation can have a different inviter user. Inviter users must be members with administrator privileges in the organization. Only \&quot;admin\&quot; members can create organization invitations. You can optionally provide public and private metadata for each organization invitation. The public metadata are visible by both the Frontend and the Backend, whereas the private metadata are only visible by the Backend.

Most recent invitations will be returned first. Any invitations created as a result of an Organization Domain are not included in the results.
  # @param organization_id The organization ID.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Float] :limit Applies a limit to the number of results returned. Can be used for paginating the results together with &#x60;offset&#x60;.

  # unit tests for revoke_organization_invitation
  # Revoke a pending organization invitation
  # Use this request to revoke a previously issued organization invitation.

Only organization invitations with \&quot;pending\&quot; status can be revoked. The request needs the &#x60;requesting_user_id&#x60; parameter to specify the user which revokes the invitation. Only users with \&quot;admin\&quot; role can revoke invitations.
